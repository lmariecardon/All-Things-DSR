# Weekly Tasks
## Create pairs for any paired assignment 

Simple code, for random listing of students, which can be used choose pairs, groups of size k < n, and order of presentations: 
```python
RPP2_students = ['Becky', 'Bahar', 'Andrew', 'Mekdi', 'Tony', 'Robert',
                 'Sean', 'Nick', 'Reza', 'Bobby', 'Di', 'Gary', 'Matthew', 'Shaheer', 'Marwah']
np.random.choice(students, replace=False, size=len(students))
```
  **challenges**  
    - Sometimes students will explain that they don't want to work with another student. Different instructors handle this differently, posting the proposed pairs/groups to the team allows feedback and maybe adjustments.  
    - Different time zones and work/family schedules can make pair programming difficult for part-time cohorts. 
    
    Ask instructor regarding:   

      - pairing based on time zones or schedules  

      - due date extensions with prior approval

## Docker
- ### sparkbook
- ### pgserv
- ### mongoserver
- ### tensorflow
    ```bash 
    docker run -it --name tensorflow -p 8888:8888 -v "$PWD":/tf tensorflow/tensorflow:2.0.0a0-py3-jupyter
 
    docker start tensorflow
    docker exec -it tensorflow bash
    ```
    Navigate to repo if you want 
    cd <path>
    In browser type: localhost:8888/
    To get token (if you don’t have a password set up)
    jupyter notebook list
    Something like this will allow you to copy and paste the highlighted part: token=f47d7c92d31140b3e12c0a68703c0a7e64944133a9e149e9
    Hopefully now, just navigate to the the repo/project
    To exit the container (all work show be saved on your local version too)
    exit
    ```bash
    docker stop tensorflow
    docker ps (to make sure)
    ```
